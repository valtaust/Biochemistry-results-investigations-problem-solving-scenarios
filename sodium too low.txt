A clinician phones adamant that the sodium for a patient is off and is too low, 
next steps, go about it if the sodium was too low?
Check the specimen quality and re-run it.
Check previous sodium results for that patient 

Check patient category and tandem analytes like K+, Cl-, 
bicarb HCO3-, creatinine/urea.

Could have said check their calcium because that shows if there is 
anticoagulant present from an IV drip. Also, if renal dialysis patient.
Fill out a result amendment form if there is a mistake.

-Assuming itâ€™s not contaminated, run the sample with a direct method like a 
blood gas analyser as the results on general chemistry analysers are affected 
by abnormally high or low total protein due to onboard dilutions. 
Would be good to do a measured osmo as well to confirm the blood gas results.

A high protein content will result in a falsely low sodium. 
A low protein will result in a falsely high sodium. 
This is something the Siemens Atellica suffers from a lot.
My textbook by William Marshall said exactly this. Lipaemia and 
then a dilution can interfere with a sodium.
Elevated glucose may cause a pseudohyponatraemia. 
Run the osmo to confirm and get accurate in-vitro result.

High triglycerides can cause pseudohyponatremia in indirect measurement assays 
particularly (indirect ISE is when the sample is diluted before analysis 
which is common in the large chem analyzers). 
In addition to the things you already mentioned, you can also 
try running the sample with another method if available, 
like a blood gas analyzer which is probably direct ISE. 
You can also look at analyzer issues (QC, cal, any peer data available). 
Also, don't forget the redraw to check results.
