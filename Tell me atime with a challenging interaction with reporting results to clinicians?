Tell me atime with a challenging interaction with reporting
results to clinicians?

When reporting results, always follow the SOP.
In one challenging situation, our lab wasn't able to meet
TAT to repeating a sample to ensure accuracy.
I followed our procedure and told the clinician tht results 
would be delayed. I knew it was not what they wanted to hear at the time
so I remained calm, considerate, & professional. 
I told her that we would have results to her _asap_ (possible)
and that quality was **extremely important to us and our patients.
